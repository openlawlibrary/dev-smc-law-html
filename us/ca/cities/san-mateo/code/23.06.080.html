Every such application shall:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> Identify and describe the work to be covered by the permit for which the application is made.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(7)">(7)</span> Give such other data and information as may be required by the building official.</p>

When such plans are not prepared by an architect or engineer, the building official may require the applicant submitting such plans or other data to demonstrate that State law does not require that the plans be prepared by a licensed architect or engineer. The building official may require plans, computations and specifications to be prepared and designed by an engineer or architect licensed by the State to practice as such even if not required by State law.</p>
                <p><strong>Exception: </strong>The building official may waive the submission of plans, calculations, construction inspection requirements and other data if it is found that the nature of the work applied for is such that reviewing of plans is not necessary to obtain compliance with this code.</p>

                <p>Plans for buildings of other than Group R, Division 3 and Group U Occupancies shall indicate how required structural and fire-resistive integrity will be maintained where penetrations will be made for electrical, mechanical, plumbing and communication conduits, pipes and similar systems.</p>

If the circumstances require, the owner may designate a substitute architect or engineer of record who shall perform all the duties required of the original architect or engineer of record. The building official shall be notified in writing by the owner if the architect or engineer of record is changed or is unable to continue to perform the duties.</p>
                <p>The architect or engineer of record shall be responsible for reviewing and coordinating all submittal documents prepared by others, including deferred submittal items, for compatibility with the design of the building.</p>

                <p>Deferral of any submittal items shall have prior approval of the building official. The architect or engineer of record shall list the deferred submittals on the plans and shall submit the deferred submittal documents for review by the building official. Submittal documents for deferred submittal items shall be submitted to the architect or engineer of record who shall review them and forward them to the building official with a notation indicating that the deferred submittal documents have been reviewed and that they have been found to be in general conformance with the design of the building. The deferred submittal items shall not be installed until their design and submittal documents have been approved by the building official.</p>

                <p>The special inspector shall be employed by the owner, the engineer or architect of record, or an agent of the owner, but not the contractor or any other person responsible for the work.</p>
