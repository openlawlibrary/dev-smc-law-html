                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> <span class="level-heading">General.</span> The building official is hereby authorized and directed to enforce all the provisions of this code and the referred technical codes. For such purposes, the building official shall have the powers of a law enforcement officer.</p>
                <p>The building official shall have the power to render interpretations of this code and the referenced technical codes, and to adopt and enforce rules and regulations supplemental to this code as may be deemed necessary to clarify the application of the provisions of this code. Such interpretations, rules and regulations shall be in conformity with the intent and purpose of this code.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> <span class="level-heading">Deputies.</span> In accordance with prescribed procedures and with the approval of the appointing authority, the building official may appoint such number of technical officers and inspectors and other employees as shall be authorized from time to time. The building official may deputize such inspectors or employees as may be necessary to carry out the functions of the code enforcement agency.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> <span class="level-heading">Right of Entry.</span> When necessary to make an inspection to enforce any of the provisions of this code and the technical codes, or when the building official has reasonable cause to believe that there exists in any building or upon a premises a condition which is contrary to or in violation of this code which makes the building or premises unsafe, dangerous or hazardous, the building official may enter the building or premises at all reasonable times to inspect or to perform the duties imposed by this code, provided that such building or premises be occupied, that credentials be presented to the occupant and entry requested. If such building or premises be unoccupied, the building official shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the owner or other persons having charge or control of the building or premises and request entry. Should entry be refused, the building official shall have recourse the remedies provided by law to secure entry.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> <span class="level-heading">Stop Orders.</span> When work is being done contrary to the provisions of this code, the technical codes, or other pertinent laws or ordinances implemented through the enforcement of this code, the building official may order the work stopped by notice in writing served on persons engaged in the doing or causing such work to be done, and such persons shall forthwith stop the work until authorized by the building official to proceed with the work.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> <span class="level-heading">Occupancy Violations.</span> When a building or structure or building service equipment therein regulated by this code and the technical codes is being used contrary to the provisions of such codes, the building official may order such use discontinued by written notice served on any person causing such use to be continued. Such person shall discontinue the use within the time prescribed by the building official after receipt of such notice to make the structure, or portion thereof, comply with the requirements of such codes.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> <span class="level-heading">Authority to Disconnect Utilities.</span> The building official or the building official's authorized representative shall have the authority to disconnect a utility service or energy supplied to the building, structure or building service equipment therein regulated by this code or the technical codes in case of emergency where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to life or property. The building official shall whenever possible notify the serving utility, the owner and occupant of the building, structure or building service equipment of the decision to disconnect prior to taking such action, and shall notify such serving utility, owner and occupant of the building, structure or building service equipment, in writing, of such disconnection immediately thereafter.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(g)">(g)</span> <span class="level-heading">Authority to Condemn Building Service Equipment.</span> When the building official ascertains that building service equipment regulated in the technical codes has become hazardous to life, health or property, or has become unsanitary, the building official shall order in writing that such equipment either be removed or restored to a safe or sanitary condition, as appropriate. The written notice itself shall fix a time limit for compliance with such order. Defective building service equipment shall not be maintained after receiving such notice.</p>
                <p>When such equipment or installation is to be disconnected, a written notice of such disconnection and causes therefore shall be given within 24 hours to the serving utility, the owner and occupant of such building, structure or premises.</p>
                <p>When any building service equipment is maintained in violation of the technical codes and in violation of a notice issued pursuant to the provisions of this section, the building official shall institute appropriate action to prevent, restrain, correct or abate the violation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(h)">(h)</span> <span class="level-heading">Connection after Order to Disconnect.</span> Persons shall not make connections from an energy, fuel or power supply nor supply energy or fuel to building service equipment which has been disconnected, ordered to be disconnected, or the use of which has been ordered to be discontinued by the building official until the building official authorizes the reconnection and use of such equipment.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(i)">(i)</span> <span class="level-heading">Liability.</span> The building official charged with the enforcement of this code and the technical codes, acting in good faith and without malice in the discharge of his duties, shall not thereby be rendered personally liable for damage that may accrue to persons or property as a result of an act or omission in the discharge of the assigned duties. A suit brought against the building official or any City employee because of such act or omission performed by the building official or employee in the enforcement of the provisions of such codes or other pertinent laws or ordinances implemented through the enforcement of this code or enforced by the code enforcement agency shall be defended by this jurisdiction until final termination of such proceedings, and any judgment resulting there from, shall be assumed by this jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>This code shall not be construed to relieve from or lessen the responsibility of any person owning, operating or controlling a building, structure or building service equipment therein for damages to persons or property caused by defects, nor shall the code enforcement agency or the City be held as assuming such liability by reason of the inspections authorized by this code or permits or the certificates issued under this code.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(j)">(j)</span> <span class="level-heading">Cooperation of Other Officials and Officers.</span> The building official may request, and shall receive, the assistance and cooperation of other officials of this jurisdiction so far as is required in the discharge of the duties required by this code or other pertinent laws and ordinances.</p>
