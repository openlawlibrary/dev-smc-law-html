                <p>WHEREAS, The "Tenant Protection Act of 2019" ("AB 1482") was enacted by the Legislature on September 11, 2019 and signed by the Governor on October 8, 2019; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, effective January 1, 2020, AB 1482 will add provisions to California landlord tenant law requiring just cause for evictions and imposing limits on rent increases; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the City Council, pursuant to its police powers, has broad authority to maintain the public peace, health, safety, and general welfare of its community and to preserve the quality of life for its residents; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, housing instability threatens the public peace, health, safety, and general welfare as eviction from one's home can lead to prolonged homelessness; increased residential mobility; loss of community; strain on household finances due to the necessity of paying rental application fees and security deposits; stress and anxiety experienced by those displaced; increased commute times and traffic impacts if displaced workers cannot find affordable housing within the city in which they work; and interruption of the education of children in the home; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, eviction creates particular hardships for individuals and households of limited means, given the shortage of housing, particularly affordable housing, within the City of San Mateo and San Francisco Bay Area region generally; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, as AB 1482 does not go into effect until January 1, 2020, landlords could seek to evict tenants without cause in order to implement rent increases that would not otherwise be possible after the effective date; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the City desires to prohibit evictions without just cause during this transition period; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the City Council finds and determines that regulating the relations between residential landlords and tenants will increase certainty and fairness within the residential rental market in the City and thereby serve the public peace, health, safety, and general welfare; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, San Mateo <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/charter/2.16" title="2.16 Emergency Ordinances.">City Charter Section 2.16</a> authorizes the adoption of an emergency ordinance to preserve the public peace, health, safety, general welfare, where there is a declaration of the reasons for urgent action and the ordinance is adopted by four-fifths (4/5) of the Council; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, An emergency ordinance that is effective immediately is necessary to avoid the immediate threat to public peace, health, safety, or welfare, as failure to adopt this emergency ordinance could result in the displacement of the City's residents and community members.</p>
                <p>NOW, THEREFORE, THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF SAN MATEO ORDAINS AS FOLLOWS:</p>
                <div class="p--section" ref-path="&#xA7;1"><h2 class="h__inline-text" id="1">Section 1. Incorporation of Recitals.</h2> <p>The City Council finds that the foregoing recitals and administrative report presented with this ordinance are true and correct and are incorporated in this ordinance by this reference and adopted as findings of the City Council.</p></div>
                <div class="p--section" ref-path="&#xA7;2"><h2 class="h__inline-text" id="2">Section 2. Findings.</h2> <p>The City Council hereby finds, determines and declares that this emergency ordinance, adopted pursuant to San Mateo <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/charter/2.16" title="2.16 Emergency Ordinances.">City Charter Section 2.16</a>, is necessary because:</p></div>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="2(a)">(a)</span> Housing, particularly affordable housing, is difficult to procure in the San Francisco Bay Area and in San Mateo.  Evictions without just cause occurring in advance of the effectiveness of AB 1482 destabilize the housing market and can result in the loss of affordable housing.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="2(b)">(b)</span> For the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, safety, and general welfare the City Council finds that it is necessary to adopt an ordinance regulating just cause evictions, for all reasons set forth in the recitals.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="2(c)">(c)</span> Without the imposition of this ordinance, evictions without cause may result in the displacement of residential tenants who would be forced to find new housing in a ever-more expensive housing market before a non-emergency ordinance or AB 1482 would become effective, and would significantly increase the risk of residential tenants becoming homeless.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="2(d)">(d)</span> There is a current and immediate threat to the public peace, health, safety, and general welfare of the City and its community due in part to the adoption of AB 1482 which increases the risk of tenant displacement prior to the effective date of the bill, thereby necessitating the immediate enactment of this emergency ordinance in order to ensure that tenant are not turned out of their homes without just cause.</p>
                <div class="p--section" ref-path="&#xA7;3"><h2 class="h__inline-text" id="3">Section 3. Urgent Need.</h2> <p>Based on the foregoing recitals and findings, all of which are deemed true and correct, this ordinance is urgently needed for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, safety, or welfare.  This ordinance shall take effect immediately upon adoption in accordance with the provisions set forth in San Mateo <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/charter/2.16" title="2.16 Emergency Ordinances.">City Charter Section 2.16</a>.</p></div>
